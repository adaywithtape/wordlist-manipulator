# WLM (Wordlist Manipulator) #

Aimed at being used on Linux Distros such as BackBox or BackTrack,
wlm is intended to simplify wordlist manipulation tasks
by having the most common wordlist manipulation options available
through an easy menu.

**Tool functionality tests**

Currently WLM has been tested on BackTrack, BackBox Linux and THS-OS Apollo (BackBox modification) distros.

Some functions of WLM (such as file replacing/overwriting when requested by user) may require root access, so on distros such as BackBox it is best to run the script as root.
(Trials currently underway to improve this)

The tool WLM is written and maintained by TAPE with various contributions from others as acknowledged in the script body.
